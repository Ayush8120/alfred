**ALFRED** (**A**ction **L**earning **F**rom **R**ealistic **E**nvironments and **D**irectives), is a new benchmark for learning a mapping from natural language instructions and egocentric vision to sequences of actions for household tasks. Long composition rollouts with non-reversible state changes are among the phenomena we include to shrink the gap between research benchmarks and real-world applications.

## Dataset

Each trajectory contains 3 or more annotations inside `traj_data.json`:

```
task_id: unique indentifier for trajectory
task_type
scene
turk_annotations
plan
images
pddl_params
```


## Code

Coming soon ...
